I've been mostly using graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecular applications because molecules can be represented with a graph structure. GNN is interesting in that it can effectively model relationships or interactions between objects in a system. Various applications of GNN exist, such as molecular applications, network analysis, and physics modeling.

I will introduce GNNs in this repository: from theoretical backgrounds to implementations using TensorFlow. I hope you enjoy GNN from this moment.
